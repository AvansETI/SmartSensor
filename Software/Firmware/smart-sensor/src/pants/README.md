# SmartSensor pants
It is possible to add different types of I/O to the SmartSensor using pants. Why pants? Just because the boards are added to the bottom of the SmartSensor. On the top of the SmartSensor there are light sensors. Ardiuno systems like to use the term hats. These elements are also added to the top of the board. So, therefore it is called pants.
